****LUDIO****

This application is intended to provide makers of low quanitity high quality instruments and audio devices to have a collective platform to leverage.  As a larger group, more potential buyers can be attarcted to see individual pieces that would be hard to market on one makers' website.  More customers should allow people that spend thier lives dedicated to the art of music to make a living without the rigors of maintaining a web presence.

In it's a current form, makers can create accounts, add items, and read/edit/delete these items/values. Customer accounts are functional in code but not implemented currently.
